### Zotonic - Simplified and Secured Logins

The idea behind this project is promote easy login process for
Zotonic.com. With increasing web applications, there needs to be way
for users to logins which is more hassle free. Moreover this needs to
be secure and safe.

* **Student:** Anant
* **Mentor:** Arjan Scherpenisse


### Ejabberd - Grapherl : stats aggregation & graphing

Grapherl is a stats aggregation and on-demand graph generation
system. Leveraging the legendary power of Erlang/OTP, it is designed
(discussed further) to be real-time & highly scalable and customizable
allowing its users to control each and every aspect as they seem
fit. Grapherl is intended but limited to gather and represent metrics
aggregated from ejabberd servers as its designed to be serviceable to
any other application producing metrics like gauge, counter or timing
values.

* **Mentor:** Mickaël Rémond


### Ejabberd - XEP-0357 app server

I want to continue implementing XEP-0357 (Push) as an ejabberd
module. The app server part shall be reusable by other XMPP servers.

* **Mentor:** Holger Weiß


### Elixir - NoSQL adapters for Ecto

The goal of the project is to explore possibility of Ecto supporting
NoSQL databases and creating a NoSQL adapter. I plan to divide time
spent on the project into three main parts: - Creating MongoDB
adapter - Extending support for SQL databases - Native MongoDB driver
or other NoSQL adapters.

* **Mentor:** José Valim


### Elixir - Project Jupyter integration

Fault tolerance approach proved to be extremely effective in area of
distributed systems. Elixir is a new language which can apply this
solution to web applications. In this proposal I do not only present
some kind of simple vision of how Elixir can become significant in
data science but also I share my point of view about important
matters: why I decide to choose this specific project, what is really
important to accomplish it as well as short description of my
experience related to this idea.

* **Mentor:** José Valim


### MongooseIM - Implementation of XEP-0322

The main goal of my project is to add support for EXI to
MongooseIM. This will also require extending the Escalus XMPP library
with the ability to communicate with MongooseIM using EXI.
